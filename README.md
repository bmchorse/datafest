# DataFest
Materials and code for Harvard DataFest workshop! This **README** contains my notes.

### Reproducible research and workflows
#### Useful resources:

#### Data
It is always gathered in specific ways with specific assumptions. Digital data is a specific encoding, in bits, of other data-- and corruptions can occur in each layer.
